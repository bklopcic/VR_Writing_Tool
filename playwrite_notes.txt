SET UP
- Need to set up computer before tests:
	- Boundary color, fade time, etc.
	- Screen resolution
	- Close unnecessary applications
	- Desktop cleanup (for real tests)
	- Desk/chair trackers on and tracking
	- Desk/chair positioned outside bounds
	- Controllers on (but hopefully not actually, see systems below)

SYSTEMS
x4 - confirm that creating project automatically loads it
~ 2 - non-required controllers for desk tracking
~ 2 - controllers visible when we don't want them to be
3 - Steam/Vive load screen should hide when changing locations
x1 - what happens if you haven't loaded a project and enter hallway
x0 - some null reference exception
5 - Leap hands flerp as well
- tiny text in project creation

DESK (Saul)
- need real controls on the desk
x- lock button doesn't work
x- world moves when you're near the desk - collision happening
- desktop mouse needs refinements - ability to touch screen
- unity crashed when we opened word
?- click / right click needs some work
(Can't reproduce)- image shows up as a white nothing on the desk cube display when copied from Chrome
- Chair tracking
x- tracking goes weird sometimes when you sit (tracking doesn't lock right now)
x- desktop needs its own light, not just light probes
x- no way of ending the parking process yet
- Desk tracker sometimes goes into standby mode and positions incorrectly
- tracker losing track
- desk behind wall is a bit odd - desk "ghostly" while moving
- desktop screen came up tiny with resolution change 
- curved screen for desktop
x- desk moving when sitting/head is close - Saul has theories
x- desk hovering off ground
- keyboard clicking with mouse will be a thing
- desk tracking lock is easy to forget about
x- when desk doesn't have track at beginning, parking is weird
- lighthouses visible through walls - ghostly like desk
~- desk tracking being weird with no parking/moving between rooms
- manage desk tracking/locking a little better
- parking position of desk, desk not disappearing

KEYBOARD
0 - fingers on keyboard are a mess, not even close
2 - explore hand models
1 - small letters, not easy to see when standing
- lighting is dark in places (for keyboard) - make keys emissive

WHITEBOARDS
x4 - positioning of whiteboard when it is created
x2 - whiteboard control button behavior (stay on when controls are turned on)
~1 - drawing while grasping - make it not happen
x5 - whiteboard colors use specified choices from mockup
0 - refinement to finger touching/movement of whiteboard
x2 - move cube should fade when controls are off
x4 - Refine whiteboard spawn sizes
7 - positioning/scale of controls
x3 - way to delete whiteboards
6 - Slider controls on whiteboard could be refined
8 - Text on whiteboards need system for text wrapping, line lengths, etc.
x2 - Show control on/off button when grasping move control
- positioning of whiteboard based on head or cube so users understand
- how much you have to pull away from whiteboard to write nicely

MENUS
~ 0 - Spawning elements from menu needs refinement (position, orientation, etc.)
3 - new icon for journal world
2 - Menu cubes spin weirdly sometimes
x 1 - Remove menu buttons for non-existing features
x- hand menu stopped working???? - priority fix permanent or not?
- actual art for room creation, office icon
- go to location menu thing blipped
- hand covering happens with menu

INTERACTION DESIGN
0 - starting orientation?
0 - need something that tells you what to do
0 - info about movement and menu
6 - inadvertent throwing of cube (hands going out of view)
x3 - "hoppy" gravity on stairs
x2 - "jitter walk"
1 - buttons flerping
5 - Misc. sounds for menus, walking, interactions, etc.
4 - Falling through the floor happens sometimes
x2 - Sometimes can "jitter walk" through walls
x- instructions for room creation - make location on cube throw, no scanning
x- auto-loading of room on creation
- position and sizing of hallway location/destination cube

LEVELS
x 0 - going off edge of treehouse - collision boundaries
x3 - the "suggested fall" area - handle this falling
x 0 - slanted areas of fence that you can go up
x1 - Add office room location to system
2 - More open pleasant locations for working are needed (less tight, constrained locations)
- lights/light probes needed in office 
- wider walkway in treehouse looks weird just stretched
- ramps are touchy at top and going down

MUSE
~ 0 - feedback for loading of room (muse)
~ 0 - thrown location block appear over hallway door
1 - need real art and/or particles for the muse
x- sometimes muse doesn't connect to nav mesh
x- keep tail on muse or not?
- some more explanation for desk stuff - finalize muse text
- muse breaks when you do things too quickly
- muse feedback for saves

MOOD AND WEATHER (Kate & Nate)
- Merge latest and generate content for presets
- All presets need sound



**try to do an executable for next test**
