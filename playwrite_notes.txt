SET UP
- Need to set up computer before tests:
	- Boundary color, fade time, etc.
	- Screen resolution
	- Close unnecessary applications
	- Desktop cleanup (for real tests)
	- Desk/chair trackers on and tracking
	- Desk/chair positioned outside bounds
	- Controllers on (but hopefully not actually, see systems below)
-Cable/chair management

SYSTEMS
~ - controllers visible when we don't want them to be - as it is now, the controllers are not visible but you need them both on for chair tracking/calibration
	~ - non-required controllers for desk tracking 
~ - Steam/Vive load screen should hide when changing locations
!! - Leap hands flerp as well

DESK
!! - unity crashes a lot... desk?
!! - some images show up as a white nothing on the desk cube display when copied from Chrome
~- click / right click needs some work - need to figure out keys or other buttons
~- Chair tracking - chair is tracked+calibrated, needs real chair art 
~ - desk behind wall is a bit odd - desk "ghostly" while moving - desk has ghostly shader, could be refined
	~ - manage desk tracking/locking a little better - materials and button change, desk is kept relative to camera rig
	~ - lighthouses visible through walls - has same ghostly material as chair, both could use actual materials to look nice	
N - curved screen for desktop
-desk tutorial / Training the user with the desk
-Parking desk refinements
-Desk legs on small desk
-mouse pointing smoothing/distance
-controller as mouse?
-instruction screen scale to size of desktop

KEYBOARD
! - fingers on keyboard are a mess, not even close
N - explore hand models
N - small letters, not easy to see when standing
N - lighting is dark in places (for keyboard) - make keys emissive

WHITEBOARDS 
! - when multiple copies of the same whiteboard are made from the desk, they all reference the same original whiteboard
	so they are made at the same scale and with the same annotations and aren't saved properly as individual whiteboards
N - positioning/scale of controls
~ - drawing while grasping - make it not happen
- Randomly stop drawing - fix this
- refinement to finger touching/movement of whiteboard
- how much you have to pull away from whiteboard to write nicely
- Slider controls on whiteboard could be refined
L - Text on whiteboards need system for text wrapping, line lengths, etc.
-Undo needs refinements - people look at whiteboard not button

MENUS
~ - Spawning elements from menu needs refinement (position, orientation, etc.) - it's better now but may need more tuning
N - actual art for room creation and deletion
N - hand covering happens with menu
-THROWING AND HAND LEAVES VIEW
-Menus palm orientation weird
-Menu closing when using menu
-system, mood, location buttons acting weird (depress when you move hand)
-possible refinements to menu movement/behavior - test with users

INTERACTION DESIGN
N - starting orientation?
N - need something that tells you what to do
	~N - info about movement and menu - there are intro signs but everyone leaves the tutorial before learning menus
	-Desk needs more tutorials
!! - inadvertent throwing of cube (hands going out of view)
! - "hoppy" gravity on stairs
!! - buttons flerping
N - Misc. sounds for menus, walking, interactions, etc.
- Falling through the floor happens sometimes - usually just when headset isn't tracking
-Movement refinement (Palm flat), - movement palm direction/angle
-Make sure people know that hands are not persistant

LEVELS
N - More open pleasant locations for working are needed (less tight, constrained locations)
N - wider walkway in treehouse looks weird just stretched
- treehouse tree thing - lighting and facing leaves

MUSE
N - need real art and/or particles for the muse
N - some more explanation for desk stuff - finalize muse text
	-Muse tell user to lock desk
!!- muse breaks when you do things too quickly
N - muse feedback for saves
-Muse instructions for desk

MOOD AND WEATHER
N - Merge latest and generate content for presets
N - All presets need sound
-Weather Merge
-Weather Documentation
-Everyone does weather first


LIST 3.0
-Pretty frikin cool
-LOTS OF INSTRUCTIONS
-so cool (that is cool)
-Play hangman?
-Cubes were intuitive
   x-But cube orientation can be weird (Throw cube behind you)
-Treehouse load time
-Nate did good nature
-Remove test worlds from system?
-More worlds (to look around?)
-interface touchy
-throwing is good


***************************************************************************************************
Final Summer To-Do List
-Weather Merge
-Weather Documentation?	

-Make sure people know that hands are not persistent

-organize scripts in master folder
-calibrator behaving oddly??? - doesn't put chair on correct controller and doesn't work right the second time
***************************************************************************************************

**try to do an executable for next test**

NATE ART ICONS PLEASE?
x- Office Icon

THINGS THAT ARE DONE
x4 - confirm that creating project automatically loads it
x1 - what happens if you haven't loaded a project and enter hallway
x0 - some null reference exception
x - tiny text in project creation
x- lock button doesn't work
x- world moves when you're near the desk - collision happening
x- desktop mouse needs refinements - ability to touch screen
x- tracking goes weird sometimes when you sit (tracking doesn't lock right now)
x- desktop needs its own light, not just light probes
x- no way of ending the parking process yet
x- Desk tracker sometimes goes into standby mode and positions incorrectly
x- tracker losing track
x- desktop screen came up tiny with resolution change 
x- desk moving when sitting/head is close - Saul has theories
