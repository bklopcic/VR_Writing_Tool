SET UP
- Need to set up computer before tests:
	- Boundary color, fade time, etc.
	- Screen resolution
	- Close unnecessary applications
	- Desktop cleanup (for real tests)
	- Desk/chair trackers on and tracking
	- Desk/chair positioned outside bounds
	- Controllers on (but hopefully not actually, see systems below)

SYSTEMS
~ - non-required controllers for desk tracking
~ - controllers visible when we don't want them to be
~ - Steam/Vive load screen should hide when changing locations
!! - Leap hands flerp as well

DESK (Saul)
N - need real control art on the desk
!! - unity crashes a lot... desk?
~ - click / right click needs some work
!! - image shows up as a white nothing on the desk cube display when copied from Chrome
~- Chair tracking
N - desk behind wall is a bit odd - desk "ghostly" while moving
	- manage desk tracking/locking a little better
	- desk tracking lock is easy to forget about
	- lighthouses visible through walls - ghostly like desk	
N - curved screen for desktop


KEYBOARD
L - fingers on keyboard are a mess, not even close
N - explore hand models
N - small letters, not easy to see when standing
N - lighting is dark in places (for keyboard) - make keys emissive

WHITEBOARDS
x - positioning of whiteboard when it is created
	- positioning of whiteboard based on head or cube so users understand
~ - drawing while grasping - make it not happen
- refinement to finger touching/movement of whiteboard
- how much you have to pull away from whiteboard to write nicely
N - positioning/scale of controls
- Slider controls on whiteboard could be refined
L - Text on whiteboards need system for text wrapping, line lengths, etc.

MENUS
~ - Spawning elements from menu needs refinement (position, orientation, etc.)
N - new icon for journal world
- Menu cubes spin weirdly sometimes
N - actual art for room creation and deletion, office icon
- go to location menu thing blipped
N - hand covering happens with menu
x- check menu handedness

INTERACTION DESIGN
N - starting orientation?
N - need something that tells you what to do
N - info about movement and menu
!! - inadvertent throwing of cube (hands going out of view)
- "hoppy" gravity on stairs
!! - buttons flerping
N - Misc. sounds for menus, walking, interactions, etc.
- Falling through the floor happens sometimes

LEVELS
N - More open pleasant locations for working are needed (less tight, constrained locations)
N - wider walkway in treehouse looks weird just stretched

MUSE
N - need real art and/or particles for the muse
N - some more explanation for desk stuff - finalize muse text
!!- muse breaks when you do things too quickly
N - muse feedback for saves

MOOD AND WEATHER (Kate & Nate)
N - Merge latest and generate content for presets
N - All presets need sound


**try to do an executable for next test**

x1 - what happens if you haven't loaded a project and enter hallway
x0 - some null reference exception
x - tiny text in project creation
x- lock button doesn't work
x- world moves when you're near the desk - collision happening
