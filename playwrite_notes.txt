SET UP
- Need to set up computer before tests:
	- Boundary color, fade time, etc.
	- Screen resolution
	- Close unnecessary applications
	- Desktop cleanup (for real tests)
	- Desk/chair trackers on and tracking
	- Desk/chair positioned outside bounds
	- Controllers on (but hopefully not actually, see systems below)

SYSTEMS
~ - non-required controllers for desk tracking
~ - controllers visible when we don't want them to be
~ - Steam/Vive load screen should hide when changing locations
!! - Leap hands flerp as well

DESK (Saul)
N - need real control art on the desk
!! - unity crashes a lot... desk?
~ - click / right click needs some work
!! - image shows up as a white nothing on the desk cube display when copied from Chrome
~- Chair tracking
N - desk behind wall is a bit odd - desk "ghostly" while moving
	- manage desk tracking/locking a little better
	- desk tracking lock is easy to forget about
	- lighthouses visible through walls - ghostly like desk	
N - curved screen for desktop


KEYBOARD
L - fingers on keyboard are a mess, not even close
N - explore hand models
N - small letters, not easy to see when standing
N - lighting is dark in places (for keyboard) - make keys emissive

WHITEBOARDS
- when multiple copies of the same whiteboard are made from the desk, they all reference the same original whiteboard
	so they are made at the same scale and with the same annotations and aren't saved properly as individual whiteboards
~ - drawing while grasping - make it not happen
- refinement to finger touching/movement of whiteboard
- how much you have to pull away from whiteboard to write nicely
N - positioning/scale of controls
- Slider controls on whiteboard could be refined
L - Text on whiteboards need system for text wrapping, line lengths, etc.

MENUS
~ - Spawning elements from menu needs refinement (position, orientation, etc.)
N - new icon for journal world
- Menu cubes spin weirdly sometimes
N - actual art for room creation and deletion, office icon
- go to location menu thing blipped
N - hand covering happens with menu

INTERACTION DESIGN
N - starting orientation?
N - need something that tells you what to do
N - info about movement and menu
!! - inadvertent throwing of cube (hands going out of view)
- "hoppy" gravity on stairs
!! - buttons flerping
N - Misc. sounds for menus, walking, interactions, etc.
- Falling through the floor happens sometimes

LEVELS
N - More open pleasant locations for working are needed (less tight, constrained locations)
N - wider walkway in treehouse looks weird just stretched

MUSE
N - need real art and/or particles for the muse
N - some more explanation for desk stuff - finalize muse text
!!- muse breaks when you do things too quickly
N - muse feedback for saves

MOOD AND WEATHER (Kate & Nate)
N - Merge latest and generate content for presets
N - All presets need sound

LIST 3.0
-Desk Screen not refreshing
-Load Room with empty project
-Drawing while grasping
-Randomly stop drawing
-Weather Merge
-Weather Documentation
-Movement refinement (Palm flat)
-Hallway doors opening with same destination
-Menu positioning weird
-Muse tell user to lock desk
-Desk needs more tutorials
-Make sure people know that hands are not persistant
-Training the user with the desk
-Parking desk refinements
-Pretty frikin cool
-LOTS OF INSTRUCTIONS
-so cool ("that is cool")
-Undo needs refinements
-Cable/chair management
-Play hangman?
-Cubes were intuitive
   -But cube orientation can be weird (Throw cube behind you)
-Menu handedness swapping weird???
-THROWING AND HAND LEAVES VIEW
-Treehouse load time
-Nate did good nature
-Moving with menu open happens a lot
-Remove test worlds from system?
-More worlds (to look around?)
-interface touchy
-throwing is good
-Make a location before going to a location (Scrolling?)
-Hardcode locations
-Desk legs on small desk
-Hide copy/paste for first time


**try to do an executable for next test**

NATE ART ICONS PLEASE?
- Office Icon
- New Journal Icon
- Desk Park Cube Icon
- Desk Lock/Unlock Icons
- Desk Copy/Paste Cube Icon
- Close menu button Icon
- Flip through options menu button icon (Triangle buttons?)


OTHER ART
- Trash bin for deleting
- Size-able chair
- Calibrator diagrams



THINGS THAT ARE DONE
x4 - confirm that creating project automatically loads it
x1 - what happens if you haven't loaded a project and enter hallway
x0 - some null reference exception
x - tiny text in project creation
x- lock button doesn't work
x- world moves when you're near the desk - collision happening
x- desktop mouse needs refinements - ability to touch screen
x- tracking goes weird sometimes when you sit (tracking doesn't lock right now)
x- desktop needs its own light, not just light probes
x- no way of ending the parking process yet
x- Desk tracker sometimes goes into standby mode and positions incorrectly
x- tracker losing track
x- desktop screen came up tiny with resolution change 
x- desk moving when sitting/head is close - Saul has theories
x- desk hovering off ground
x- when desk doesn't have track at beginning, parking is weird
x- parking position of desk, desk not disappearing
x2 - whiteboard control button behavior (stay on when controls are turned on)
x5 - whiteboard colors use specified choices from mockup
x2 - move cube should fade when controls are off
x4 - Refine whiteboard spawn sizes
x3 - way to delete whiteboards
x2 - Show control on/off button when grasping move control
x 1 - Remove menu buttons for non-existing features
x- hand menu stopped working???? - priority fix permanent or not?
x2 - "jitter walk"
x2 - Sometimes can "jitter walk" through walls
x 0 - going off edge of treehouse - collision boundaries
x3 - the "suggested fall" area - handle this falling
x 0 - slanted areas of fence that you can go up
x1 - Add office room location to system
x- lights/light probes needed in office 
x- instructions for room creation - make location on cube throw, no scanning
x- auto-loading of room on creation
x 0 - feedback for loading of room (muse)
x 0 - thrown location block appear over hallway door
x- sometimes muse doesn't connect to nav mesh
x- keep tail on muse or not?
x - positioning of whiteboard when it is created
	- positioning of whiteboard based on head or cube so users understand
x- check menu handedness
