# Desk Overview  
The Desk is a combination of many different parts. It contains many separate features that were programmed at different times, so some of the code could be improved to encompass the whole system.  
  
#### `DeskManager.cs` - Manages Desk States  
The Desk Manager is responsible for changing and reacting to Desk States (Disabled, Placing, Enabled, Parking), these are often changed through cube throws or button presses.   
  
#### `DeskController.cs` - Manages Desk Functionality (Poorly Named)  
The Desk Controller is responsible for positioning the desktop mirror display as well as updating the copy/paste cube.  
  
  
##### Honestly this system needs an orginazational rework. It's very fragmented but gets the job done.
