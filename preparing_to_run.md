# Preparing to Run PLAY | WRITE

In order to run PLAY | WRITE without everything breaking a couple things need to be setup right.  
1. Make sure that the Hallway Scene and CRUD Scene are additively loaded. 
2. The Hallway Scene needs to be the active scene before entering playmode
  
  
  
Testing Checklist:  
- Boundary color, fade time, etc.
- Screen resolution
- Close unnecessary applications
- Desktop cleanup (for real tests)
- Desk/chair trackers on and tracking
- Desk/chair positioned outside bounds
- Controllers on (but hopefully not actually, see systems below)
